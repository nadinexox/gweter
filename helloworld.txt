Hi. How did you get out there? The fire escape. Your doorman's intimidating. It's 20 stories. Yeah, it's all right.
How did you get out there? The fire escape. Your doorman's intimidating.
This is your room. Yes, this is my room. Books. Shoes.
Oh, hey. I got your mom these. Oh, lovely. Beautiful, right? They're beautiful. They were nice. No, they're beautiful. I'm sorry. No, it's impressive. They actually held together very well. I'm gonna keep these.

You're having trouble there, aren't you? The head goes on the other- Simon, help Gwen's friend with his fish. Oh, I. I got no idea. First time. Branzino.
Thank you for having me. I'm sorry if I insulted you. It was not my intention. You're welcome. Branzino was real good, Mrs. Stacy.
Let's get some air, Peter. Dad, we need to talk. Yes, we do.
Let's get some air, Peter.
Well, that was something.
I'm sorry, I thought he was going to arrest me at one point. Nah, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.
I'm sorry, I thought he was going to arrest me at one point.
Nah, I wouldn't have let him arrest you.
What happened to your face- I'm gonna tell you something. Oh. Okay.
I've been bitten. So have I.
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. I gotta tell you this one thing, and it's about the vigilante and the care thief. Alright?
Oh, okay. No, no, no, no, no. Don't. No. Ok no. Forget that, I'm not gonna talk about that. I'm gonna talk about me, okay?
What about you? It's impo- I wish I could just. I can't. It's hard to say.

You? You're Spider-Man. Shut up.
Oh, I'm in trouble.
It's so beautiful. Knows how to bite though.
Who else knows about this? Just you.
Who else knows about this? Just you. Really?
Hey, you don't. You don't believe what the police are saying, do you? Of course not.
Does it scare you? What you can do? No. No.
Does it scare you? What you can do?
What did that thing on the bridge look like? It was real big. Too big to be human.
You gotta lay low.
You gotta lay low. No, can't do that. You've got to. I mean, why-
Because of last night. Those people on the bridge. Whatever was attacking them would've killed them. So, I gotta go after it.
I gotta go after it. That's not your job. Maybe it is.
I really liked kissing you. You're an amazing kisser. Well, you know, it was, it was good for me too. Yeah?
Come in. You should maybe... consider coming in through the lobby. Also, my father is under the impression that you require psychiatric attention. Oh, really?
Peter. What happened? You should see the other guy. The other guy, in this instance, being a giant mutant lizard.
Chocolate house.
Easy, Bug Boy. What'd you call me?
Easy, Bug Boy.
What'd you call me?
I know what this is. What is it?
I know what this is. What is it? Every day, for as long as I can remember, my father has left every morning and he's put a badge on his chest and strapped a gun to his hip.
Every day, for as long as I can remember, my father has left every morning and he's put a badge on his chest and strapped a gun to his hip. And every day, for as long as I can remember, I haven't known if he was gonna make it home.
I gotta stop him, though. I have to, because I created him. 
I have to, because I created him. What do you mean? I gave him an equation, that made all of this possible. Something my father had been working on, you know. Secretly. Now I realise why he kept it a secret. Point is, this is my responsibility. I have to fix it.
Hey. Let's get out of here. Let's just get out of here. Just for a minute. Can we? No. No. Yeah. Yes. Yes. No. Yes.
If my parents see me leaving, I'm dead. Your parents aren't gonna see you leaving.
I'm gonna throw you out the window now. What?
Hey. Where are you? I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm in the sewer, tracking him. I gotta stop him before anyone gets hurt.
But we need an antidote. Do you know how to run a serum? Yeah, I do it for Connors all the time. Okay, great. Okay, listen I need you to go to Oscorp. I need you to access the cross-species file. It's a blue serum. File 12389. Okay, got it. On my way.
Hi. Where are you? Peter, hi. I'm at Oscorp. You have to get out of there right now, okay? The antidote is cooking. No, no, no. Connors is on the way. He's coming to you right now. He needs the disbursement device. He's gonna infect the whole city!
 You have to get out of there right now, okay?
There's eight minutes left. You're gonna wait there for eight minutes after what I just told you? People are gonna die!
You're gonna wait there for eight minutes after what I just told you?
You leave right now. That is an order, okay?
You leave right now. That is an order, okay? I'm gonna get everybody out. Did you hear wh- Gwen! Gwen! You mother hubbard. Are you serious?
Gwen! Gwen! You Mother Hubbard. Are you serious?
It's headed to Oscorp! And your daughter's there right now. You gotta let me go.
Dad! I have to get this to Spider-Man. Get in. It can stop the Lizard. Get in the car.
You don't understand! Yes, I do. Your boyfriend is a man of many masks. I get it. Give me this. Get in the car. Please make sure he's okay.
Your boyfriend is a man of many masks. I get it.
Please make sure he's okay.
Hey! Gift from Gwen.
You're gonna make enemies. People will get hurt. So I want you to promise me something, okay? Leave Gwen out of it. Promise me that. You promise me.
So I want you to promise me something, okay? Leave Gwen out of it.
Where have you been? Hi. My father died. There was a funeral. They shot off rifles and they made speeches.
My father died. There was a funeral. They shot off rifles and they made speeches. Two of my teachers showed up. And Flash showed up. Everyone was there but you.
Can't do this. Can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't- What are you saying? I can't see you any more. I can't.
He made you promise, didn't he? To stay away from me, so I'd be safe.
What a pretty girl. Yeah. That's what Uncle Ben said. Did you ask her out? Why? Can't. Why? I'm just no good for her.
What a pretty girl. Yeah. That's what Uncle Ben said. Did you ask her out? Why? Can't. Why? I'm just no good for her. Peter Parker, if there's one thing you are, it's good. Anyone has a problem with that can talk to me.
Don't make promises you can't keep Mr. Parker. Yeah, but those are the best kind.
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm running a bit late. I got stuck in some traffic. Your timing is terrible. It started already. I know, I'm sorry.
Where are you? 1st and Broadway, 2nd and Broadway, 3rd and Broadway. Five minutes. Ten tops.
Are those sirens? No. Peter? No. Peter? No sirens. No... Peter. What is happening? Peter. Peter. Hello? Peter? Pe... I'll be right there. Promise.
Cheese!
Hey. Did your traffic jam have anything to do with the Russian Mob and machine guns by any chance?
Did your traffic jam have anything to do with the Russian Mob and machine guns by any chance? Why didn't you just tell me? What am I gonna do? You're about to do your speech.
Hey. You coming to dim sum? Can't keep me away.
Hey. You coming to dim sum? Can't keep me away. It's at 8: 00. Don't be late. I won't be. Okay.
And I'm gonna do my speech for you. All night? I wanna hear it all night long. Over and over again, all night long. Okay. Oh, my gosh. It was pretty good.
Peter's outside. I'm gonna go see if he's okay.
Peter. What is it? Hey. What's wrong? Are you all right? I don't know what I'm doing. It's my father, isn't it?
It's my father, isn't it? Yeah. I see him everywhere I go. I can't, I don't know what to do. And I can't get him out of my head.
I see him everywhere I go. I can't, I don't know what to do. And I can't get him out of my head. Yeah, but we've talked about this. I know, but, Gwen... It's not his choice.
I promised him that I would keep away from you. And now I'm gonna come and eat dinner with your family. How can I do this? What does this make me?
What does this make me? I don't know, what does that make you? It makes me not able to live with myself.
I thought that it meant you loved me. I do love you. I love you. Then why isn't that enough?
Because what if something happens to you just like it happened to him because of me? No, wait, wait, wait. Listen. No, n... I cannot let that happen.
Because what if something happens to you just like it happened to him because of me?
Listen to me. You're Spider-Man, and I love that. But I love Peter Parker more.
That's worth it to me.
I can't lose you too.
I can't lose you too. If because you can't lose me, we can't be together, who does that work out for, Peter?
I can't. I'm sorry, Gwen. Wow. You have done this to me again and again, Peter. I can't live like this. I break up with you. I break up with you.
Wow. You have done this to me again and again, Peter. I can't live like this. I break up with you. I break up with you.
What? You got a lady? Uh... That's a question. That's a question.
Uh, what's her name? Who is she? Her name's Gwen. Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy. She works for you. Really? She works for me? She does work-study at Oscorp.
Her name's Gwen. Gwen Stacy. Gwen Stacy. She works for you.
Hey. Hi. Hi. You look amazing.
I'm sorry for the spontaneous outreach. It was kind of. No. I don't... I... Spontaneous... is all right. You know.
Well, I just figured it was time. You know? Time that we try to be friends. Yeah. Friends, yeah. That's... great. I just don't want us to be complicated. I was just saying that to someone. I hate complicated. Keep it simple.
Okay, great, great. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right.
Well, I mean... Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think we gotta establish some ground rules.
Well, I mean... Ha, ha. If we're gonna be friends, I think we gotta establish some ground rules. Some ground rules? Yeah, some ground rules.
Like that. Like what? That laugh. That laugh. What? That's off the table. My laugh is off the table? Off the table. You gotta figure out a more annoying laugh. [LAUGHS LOUDLY] That's still adorable. That was not adorable. It's adorable. No, it's not adorable.
Okay. I have a ground rule. Um... Oh, good. What is it? Uh... Don't tell me that I look amazing with your big brown doe eyes. Okay? I'm really serious about that one.
Oh, no. What? I just figured out the next ground rule.
I just figured out the next ground rule. What? No more of this. No more of this little nose rub that you do. This? Don't think I haven't... Hey. What am I supposed to do? It's allergy season.
No more of this little nose rub that you do. This? Don't think I haven't... Hey. What am I supposed to do? It's allergy season.
It's allergy season.
This is killing me. You're just spitting in the face of my ground rules. I'm out.
First we get ice cream, and then I'm out.
Um, yeah. So I did that. And I got completely addicted to this place that has Korean meatballs.
Yeah. No, I know. Have you been there? It's mind-blowing. That place on 6th. I know. You love it there.
I know. You love it there. How do you know that? Hm? How do you know I love it there? Because, um... Because you told me. [EXHALING RAPIDLY] It just opened last month.
Have you been following me? I knew it. How often? Just once a day. Sometimes. Sometimes more. Oh, boy.
Have you been following me? I knew it. How often? Just once a day. Sometimes. Sometimes more. Oh, boy. Why? To make sure I'm safe? And... And what? And because it's the closest I can get to still being with you.
And because it's the closest I can get to still being with you.
I'm moving to England.
I'm moving to England. What? Yeah. Um... I have a... I'm up for a scholarship to Oxford.
It's between me and this other kid. There's this oral exam that we have to do and he's, like, a freshman in college, but he's 14. And... And it's... it could be him. But it might be me. I hope it's me. And I'm thinking that I'll be moving to England.
And I'm thinking that I'll be moving to England. Wow. Yeah. And I'm really excited. That's, uh... England.
Hi. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? 
You're in trouble. Yeah. Who's that guy? There was an accident in the genomics lab, and they're covering it up. And I found out.
That guy from Times Square last night? I met him. He was an electrical engineer in the building. And he loved Spider-Man, by the way. He was, like, a fanatic.
And he loved Spider-Man, by the way. He was, like, a fanatic. I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a "want to kill me with his electricity" vibe. That's actually kind of what it's like to love you.
I didn't get love vibes. I got more of a "want to kill me with his electricity" vibe. That's actually kind of what it's like to love you.
I was searching for him in the computer and all the files, he's erased. My God. He's completely erased. That's Oscorp.
And what about you? Why are you here? Harry. Osborn? He's dying. What do you mean? He's dying.
Harry. Osborn? He's dying. What do you mean? He's dying. And he thinks the only thing that's gonna save his life is my blood, is Spider-Man's blood. And as far as I know, if I give it to him, it could kill him. Or something worse.
This is the maintenance closet, Gwen. This is the most cliched hiding place you could've chosen. This is the stupidest hiding place. I'm sorry, I didn't take us to the Bahamas of hiding places.
I'm sorry, I didn't take us to the Bahamas of hiding places.
his is the most cliched hiding place you could've chosen.
I gotta talk to you about England, I guess, because I don't...
You just kissed me. I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.
You just kissed me. I know, I'm sorry. I couldn't help it. How'd you like it? It felt a little bit rushed. I know. I know, I know.
This is the plan. You get to the elevator. I'm gonna distract him, okay? Okay.
Ooh! God! Damn it! I'm so... I just spilled a hot latte all over your... I didn't mean to do that. Oh, no! And you too? I'm sorry. Wait, wait, wait. All right. On your way. Aah. I'm sorry. I'm all thumbs today.
I thought you two had broken up. Oh. Yeah. Yes, we had. And it's... It's complicated. Complicated. Yeah.
It's complicated.
I mean, it's Peter. Heh. Everything's always complicated with Peter. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you're right. But that's why he needs you. Right? To help him make his choices clear.
Unh! Hey! Hi. Hi. Hi, I gotta talk to you for a second. I'm running late right now. It's just gonna take a second. I can't. I'm sorry, Peter. Just give me one minute.
I just wanna say one thing and I'm gone. Everything's a mess. Everything's insane. My dad, my mom. Everything I thought about them? Lies. Ha! Lies. Lies, lies, lies. Nothing makes any sense anymore.
I gotta figure out what I'm gonna do with Harry. Of course I wanna save him. You know? I wanna save him because he's my best pal. And what if my blood works? But what if it doesn't? I don't know. I got no idea.
[PETER LAUGHING AND GWEN CHUCKLING] Oh, God. I got nothing! I got nothing!
I got nothing. I got nothing. The only thing I keep coming back to, Gwen, is... [SIGHS]
I'm... Ahem. Okay. I have to be... [WHISPERING] Where are we? I'm at my... last interview for Oxford right now. Oxford. I didn't know. Yeah. Oh. Okay, well...
My fair lady, madam. But who am I? I mean, who am I? I'm John Hopkins. I'm one of the young professors at Harvard, and I've been trying to get her to be in my, be a part of my team for a while now. And she's just the best person I know and a scientific genius. God save the queen.
Peter. Peter. What do you want to say to me? What's the "one thing"?
I'm John Hopkins. I'm one of the young professors at Harvard, and I've been trying to get her to be in my, be a part of my team for a while now.
[SIGHS] I have to go to England, Peter. It's important to me. I mean, I don't know. Maybe we're on different paths right now. You know? I don't know. Maybe we're just going different ways. I don't... I've gotta go. I gotta go.
Gwen. Good luck. [POINTING THUMBS UP]
*You have one new voice message* Hi, Peter, it's me. Uh, I got in to Oxford. Woo-hoo. It's very exciting.
VOICEMAIL: I came by your house a little bit ago and I, um... You weren't there, and so I'm on my way to the airport right now, because there's this early summer class that I found out about, and I thought that it would somehow be easier, I guess, this way.
VOICEMAIL: I think that maybe it's time to let this go. And that's not because I don't love you. It's actually because I do, so, um... Okay, bye.
It's Spider-Man! Stop the cab. Lady, I ain't even moving.
Whoa! Hi. Hi. Did you get my message? What message? The message right there. Oh, that. That was you? Don't do that. I couldn't make it out. I'll tell you what it says. Says, "I love you." Because I love you.
I'll tell you what it says. Says, "I love you." Because I love you.
And no offense, but you're wrong. I'm wrong about what? You're wrong about us being on different paths. We're not on different paths. You're my path. And you're always gonna be my path.
You're my path.
And you're always gonna be my path.
And I know there's a million reasons why we shouldn't be together. I know that. But I'm tired of them. I'm tired of every single one of them.
We've all gotta make a choice. Right? Well, I choose you.
Well, I choose you.
So here's my thought. England. Both of us. [CHUCKLES] I'm following you now. I'm just gonna follow you everywhere. I'm just gonna follow you the rest of my life. I mean, they got crime there in England.
I mean, they got crime there in England.
England. Both of us.
I mean, they got crime there in England. Yeah. They got tons of crime, it seems. Tons. They got, uh, Jack the Ripper. Heh, heh. What? They haven't caught Jack the Ripper yet. You didn't know that?
There's gotta be some kind of blackout plan, right? Some kind of backup? There's an emergency reset at the power plant. If he cuts the transmission lines, they're never gonna get this back up. How will I stop him?
Everytime I get close, he fries my web shooters. Have you tried grounding them? Tried everything. Did you try magnetizing them? I didn't try magnetizing them. Okay, well, remember 8th grade science class? If you magnetize a nail with a battery. It holds an electric charge. Yes.
Am I talking louder than I usually talk right now?! Yes. Ho.
Did you try magnetizing them?
Okay, well, remember 8th grade science class?
All right, do it. [GWEN SHRIEKS] Okay, good. Try, try, try. Hurry, hurry, hurry. Okay, it works, good. That is why you were number two at Midtown! Rub it in. Okay. Heh.
That is why you were number two at Midtown!
Gwen, you're not coming with me. Yes, I am. Its too dangerous. Im coming with you, I've seen the grid specs and I know how to reset the system. Im coming with you! You need me! Okay, shut up. You're coming with me! Shut the thing. [WEBS HAND TO CAR] Sorry I love you don't hate me
I'm coming with you. You're not coming with me. Yes, I am. It's too dangerous. I'm coming with you, I've seen the grid specs and I know how to reset the entire system. I'm coming with you! You know that you need me! Okay, shut up. You're coming with me! Shut the thing. [WEBS HAND]
[WEBS HAND TO CAR] Sorry. I love you. Don't hate me. Peter!
Peter!
I'm coming with you, I've seen the grid specs and I know how to reset the entire system.
Really? You web me to a car? What are you, a caveman? You shouldn't be here. You tie me up to go off to war?
I know how to help you! What are you doing here?! I know the grid specs. I can reset the system! You cant be here right now. I'm not messing around. You cant be here right now. This is insane. Nobody makes my decisions for me. All right? Nobody. This is my choice okay? My choice.
Now, how do we stop him? Okay, so he's electric, he's like a battery. What happens if you overcharge a battery? It explodes. Right. So we use his power against him. Perfect.
I think I can reconnect the power lines. But I need you to reset the system. Okay, when I say you turn that power on, you turn it on. No matter what. Peter... No. Matter. What.
Now, Gwen, now! Do it now!
Gwen, stay there.
[GWEN SHRIEKS] I got you, Gwen. I'm gonna put you down right here.
Hey. Hey. Gwen? Hey. Hey! Gwen? Hey. Breathe. Hey, Gwen. Hey. Hey. You're okay. Gwen?
[SOBBING] Stay with me, stay with me. Stay with me, stay with me. You stay with me. Gwen. Gwen! No, please, please. Please. I can't do this without you.
I lost Gwen. My uh... she was my MJ. I couldn't save her. And I'm never going to be able to forgive myself for that.
I lost Gwen. My uh... she was my MJ.
And I'm never going to be able to forgive myself for that.
But I carried on, tried to, tried to keep going. Tried to keep being that, that friendly neighborhood Spider-Man, because I know that's what she would've wanted, but at some point, I stopped pulling my punches. I got rageful. I got bitter. I just don’t want you to end up like me.
You have someone? No. Got no time for Peter Parker stuff. Do you? Um… That’s a little complicated. No, I understand. I guess it’s just not in the cards for guys like us.
No. Got no time for Peter Parker stuff.
And she's just the best person I know and a scientific genius.
